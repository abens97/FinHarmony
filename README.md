# FinHarmony

FinHarmony is a training organization in finance for business https://www.finharmony.net 
Since several years of operation, we have built a large unstructured base of learning resources and learning content under various formats (stored on our server). And we want to tag and index this content to be able to search and retrieve it efficiently for future developments, mainly during the instructional design of new trainings.

The objective of the project is to explore indexing solutions based on new technologies, design the concept of a new referencing tool, and implement it based on following requirements:
▪ Low cost
▪ Easy implementation
▪ Light workload on users’ side (at initiation stage and during running phase)
▪ Ability to reference several formats (text, graphs, images, videos, html links, Windows Office files, pdf files, but also questioning quiz, pedagogical games, etc.) and several languages (at least French and English)
▪ If possible, add artificial intelligence language learning abilities Specifications / Tasks
▪ Investigating existing solutions based on new technologies ▪ Making proposals to management for decision and kick-off ▪ Designing the concept of a new indexing/referencing tool ▪ Scheduling and launching the implementation
